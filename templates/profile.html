          <h1>Profile</h1>
          <p><strong>Placeholder Name</strong> was once a senior consultant at a successful cybersecurity firm. 
          Specializing in red teaming and penetration testing, he was at the top of his game. But everything crumbled 
          when the firm unexpectedly went bust due to corporate mismanagement. Now, with no safety net or financial 
          backup, all he has are the skills he’s honed over years of working in the shadows of the digital world and 
          the clothes on his back. He's determined to rise again, but how he chooses to do that is up to you.</p>

    <!-- Moral Alignments -->
      <div class="alignment black-hat">
          <h3>Black Hat</h3>
          <p>Will you use your skills for personal gain? As a Black Hat, you'll hack for profit and power, taking 
          down corporations, leaking sensitive information, and building a criminal empire in the digital shadows. 
          You might gain wealth and control, but at the cost of becoming a target for law enforcement and rival hackers.</p>
    </div>
      
      <div class="alignment white-hat">
          <h3>White Hat</h3>
          <p>As a White Hat, you fight for justice. Aligning yourself with law enforcement, ethical hackers, and NGOs, 
          you’ll expose corruption and defend personal privacy. You’ll be a force for good, but this path is not 
          without danger — those who profit from the dark side of the digital world won’t take kindly to your interference.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="alignment grey-hat">
          <h3>Grey Hat</h3>
          <p>Will you walk the line between right and wrong? As a Grey Hat, you use your skills for curiosity and 
          personal ethics, sometimes working with the law, and other times bending the rules to your will. You’ll 
          be a wildcard, making enemies on both sides, but also gaining the freedom to shape your destiny as you see fit.</p>
